1. Master Icons (Option C – how to use what you already have)

Use the striped WZOS square (no text) as your single master icon and export it in these three “hero” sizes; your app builder can scale everything else from there.

a) iOS master icon

Size: 1024 × 1024 px

Format: PNG

Background: Transparent

Content: Center the WZOS striped square, leave ~12–15% padding on all sides.

b) Android adaptive master

Foreground:

1024 × 1024 px PNG

Transparent background

WZOS square centered, ~60–70% of width (plenty of padding).

Background:

1024 × 1024 px PNG

Solid brand color (e.g., #FFB300 safety yellow or deep charcoal).
Most app builders will accept a single 1024 PNG and generate adaptive variants automatically; if that’s the case, just give it the same master icon as iOS.

c) PWA master icon

Size: 512 × 512 px

Format: PNG

Background: Transparent

Same artwork as iOS, just exported at 512.

d) Splash screen (uses Version B: square + “WORK ZONE OS” + ©)

Size: 2048 × 2048 px (safe for all densities; your tool will crop center).

Background: Brand color or dark grey.

Artwork:

Full logo (striped square + “WORK ZONE OS” + small © bottom-right of block).

Centered, occupying ~40–50% of width.

Once you export those 4 images, your app creator can generate all required resolutions (iOS icons, Android mipmaps, PWA icons) from them.
